# Setting Up Linux For NiFi
This is a guide to setup multi-node NiFi Cluster in CentOS7

## 1. Downloading Required Stuff:

* CentOS7ISO.
* VirtualBox.

## 2. Creating a VM Using VirtualBox:

* Click on the new button.
* Add the name of the VM as per your choice. 1. Type: Linux 2. Version: Red-Hat (64 bit)
* Assign memory according to the current Memory installed on your system. (4GB Recommended)
* Select Create a virtual hard disk now option
* Select VDI (Virtualbox Disk Image)
* Select Dynamically Allocated
* Assign the storage according to the available storage on your system. (Atleast 8GB)
* Creating Adapters 1. Goto File > Host Network Manager 2. There are 3 buttons shown namely: create, remove and properties 3. Create 2 Adapters and name them vboxnet0 and       vboxnet1
* Now go back to the VirtualBox and select the VM that is just created and click on the settings button.
* Goto Adapter tab. 1. Under Adapter2 tab, select the Enable Network Adapter checkbox and assign virtualbox host ethernet adapter. 2. Goto Adapter3 tab, select the Enable Network Adapter checkbox and assign virtualbox host ethernet adapter1 .
* Now goto Storage tab in settings and Select the empty disk. on the right side, add the CentOS7 ISO Image.
* Now run the VM

## 3. Installation of CentOS7 on VM

* Select the language
* Add date and time
* Goto Network and Hostname and select all 3 adapters
* Click on Begin Installation
* add root password

## 4. Setup Static IP Address:

* To set a static IP address, use the following command to add configurations:
```
vi /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-enp0s8

```        
* File will open with the following contents:
```
 TYPE=Ethernet
 BOOTPROTO=dhcp
 DEFROUTE=yes
 PEERDNS=yes
 PEERROUTES=yes
 IPV4_FAILURE_FATAL=no
 IPV6INIT=yes
 IPV6_AUTOCONF=yes
 IPV6_DEFROUTE=yes
 IPV6_PEERDNS=yes
 IPV6_PEERROUTES=yes
 IPV6_FAILURE_FATAL=no
 NAME=enp0s8
 UUID=c3fb64f0-6ff5-4294-9354-8e1279971d7e
 DEVICE=enp0s8
 ONBOOT=no

```

* change the following 
```
 BOOTPROTO=static
 ONBOOT=yes
 IPADDR=192.168.XXX.XXX
 NETMASK=255.255.255.0

```

* restart the network by executing the command:
```
systemctl restart network
```

## Yum Update
  Update yum using the following command:
  ```
   yum update
  ```
  
## Check memory and storage
To check memory and storage of linux write the following commands respectively:
```
free -m
df -h
```

## 5.Maximum number of open file requirements
* To check the current number of available number of open file descriptors, use the following command:
```
  ulimit -Sn
  ulimit -Hn
```
* To set the value of open file descriptors. (recommended: 10000)
```
 ulimit -n 10000
```

## 6. Changing Hostname of machine
* By Default, the hostname is: ```local host```
* To check the current running hostname, run the following command:
```
hostname -f
```
* To check the details of hostname, run the command:
```
hostnamectl
```
* To change the hostname of the system:
```
 hostnamectl set-hostname hostname
```

* reboot the system using ```reboot``` command

## 7.Setting the hostname in the hostfile

* To view the hosts in the hosts file, enter the following command:
```
vi /etc/hosts
```
* add the hosts in a fashion of adding an IP of a node and the hostname, the sample is given below:
```
 127.0.0.1   localhost localhost.localdomain localhost4 localhost4.localdomain4
 ::1         localhost localhost.localdomain localhost6 localhost6.localdomain6
 192.168.XXX.XXX master.company.com master
 192.168.YYY.XXX datanode1.company.com datanode1 
 192.168.XXX.YYY datanode2.company.com datanode2
```
* master, datanode1 and datanode2 are name of machines
* Repeat the same step and add this in other machines also

## 9. Setup NTP on the server and the browser host
NTP ensures that the clocks of the nodes in the cluster are synchronized. follow the steps given below in order to set the NTP on each node:
* Install NTP using the command:
```
 yum install -y ntp
```

* Enable NTP using the command:
```
 systemctl enable ntpd
```

* Following commands are used to start and restart the NTP service.
```
 systemctl start ntpd
 systemctl restart ntpd
```

* If you want to check the sync status, use the following command:

```
 ntpstat
```

## 10. Disabling Firewalls

write the following commands in linux to disable firewall:

```
 systemctl disable firewalld
 service firewalld stop
```

## 11. Set the Network Config File
* Change the contents of the following file by using the command:
 ```
  vi /etc/sysconfig/network
 ```
* make the following changes in the file:
```
 NETWORKING=yes
 HOSTNAME=localhost
```

## 12. Disable SELinux and PackageKit and check umask value
It is important to disable SELinux.
* Use the following command to disable SELinux:
```
setenforce 0
```

* to permenantly disable SELinux, make sure to set ```SELINUX=disabled``` in the following file to make sure that it is not enables after the system is rebooted:

```
vi /etc/selinux/config
```

* To check the current umask, run the following command:
```
 umask
 ```
 
* set the umask just fot the current login session:
```
umask 0022
```

* permenantly changing the umask for all the users:
```
 echo umask 0022 >> /etc/profile
```

# NiFi Installation on a single Node:
* create new non-root user named nifi
```
cd /home/nifi

```

* then to download nifi file write following command: 

```
wget -O nifi-1.12.1-bin.tar.gz https://downloads.apache.org/nifi/1.12.1/nifi-1.12.1-bin.tar.gz
```

* Extract the file and go to extracted file:

```
tar -xvf nifi-1.12.1-bin.tar.gz
cd nifi-1.12.1
cd bin

```

* By default nifi will have port 8080 if you want to change the port then follow the steps
```
cd /home/nifi/nifi-1.12.1/conf
ls
vi nifi.properties


```
search for port or 8080 and change it to whatever you want to

* Checking Services of Nifi
go to bin folder of nifi-1.12.1 and execute the following command and will give you service for nifi
``` 
./nifi.sh â€“help 
```

* Starting NiFi and checking status

```
./nifi.sh start
./nifi.sh status
```

**Got Error During startup of NiFi solution was to install Java**

## Installing Java
Install Java 8 or 11 because nifi only supports these Java

also install it in 	```cd /home/nifi```

* Add the following command to download java in linux ( I specifically download Java 8 ) 

```
wget -c --header "Cookie: oraclelicense=accept-securebackup-cookie" http://download.oracle.com/otn-pub/java/jdk/8u131-b11/d54c1d3a095b4ff2b6607d096fa80163/jdk-8u131-linux-x64.tar.gz -O jdk-8-linux-x64.tar.gz
```
* Then extract the downloaded file

```
tar -xvf jdk-8-linux-x64.tar.gz
```

* Finding Java
```
cd /home/nifi/jdk1.8.0_131
cd bin
```

## Setting Path of Java

* Go to bash and add the following command:

```
export JAVA_HOME=/home/nifi/jdk1.8.0_131
```
To check if Java is working write ``` java ``` in linux shell.

## Starting NiFi:

* Write the following command to start Nifi:

```
./nifi.sh start 
```

* Go to nifi folder then go to logs
then write following command:

```
tail -f nifi-app.log
```

if its running properly it will show ip of machine with the port that you have set.
Enter the Ip address of machine with port in windows browser
For Example: ``` 192.168.XXX.XXX:8080 ```
